FIX LOG
I was trying to figure out a way to do this in a manner that could easily *be reapplied if the plugins where to get upgraded. In the end, this is *mainly, the only thing I can do, which is to log every change and go through each error I find one by one reapplying them as there seems to be no api to connect with plugins. I'm sure there is a way but it is not well documented and so the following changes should be reapplied in case of a plugin upgrade.
