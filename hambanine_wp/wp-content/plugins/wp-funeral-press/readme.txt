= Shortcode =
The main shortcode for the obit page is [funeralpress]. You need to add this shortcode to one page to make the obits work. Make sure it is only listed on one page, multiple pages will cause errors.

There is a shortcode available to use to display latest obits and this can be used on as many pages as you want

Shortcode: [fp_latest_obits style="x" howmany="x" search="x"]

** Configuration for shortcode **

* style: Choose one of the following (list,thumbnails,block)
* howmany: type how many obits you want to display (defaults to your paging setting in admin if not set)
* search:  change to "1" if you want to display the search box.
* Example: [fp_latest_obits style="thumbnails" howmany="5" search="1"]

= Widget =

* To use the widget drag the "Funeral Press Obits" widget into your sidebar, set the settings for the widget to display obits.

= Custom CSS =

* If you want to change the css of the plugin its recommended that you create a css file by the name of obit.css in your template directory. This ensures that any css changes will not get overwritten in future. This is explained more if you go to settings->Custom CSS
